# **Epic 5: AI Sales Brain ‚Äì Strategic Memory, Reasoning, and Real-Time Sales Copilot \- Detailed User Journeys**

## **Epic Overview**

**Vision:** Transform GreendoorAI from an automated execution engine into a true AI Sales Partner‚Äîan always-on, memory-rich, context-aware strategist that understands every account, learns from every interaction, and proactively guides reps toward revenue success.

**Core Problem:** Even with sophisticated deal orchestration, reps still spend hours searching for context, piecing together account history, preparing for meetings, and figuring out next best actions. Critical insights are buried in emails, transcripts, and CRM fields, while strategic guidance requires deep tribal knowledge.
