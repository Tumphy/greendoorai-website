## **🔧 ERROR HANDLING & RECOVERY PROCEDURES**

### **Autonomous System Recovery Architecture**

#### **Circuit Breaker Patterns**

**External API Circuit Breakers:**

\# Circuit Breaker Implementation Example  
class ExternalAPICircuitBreaker:  
    def \_\_init\_\_(self, failure\_threshold=5, recovery\_timeout=60):  
        self.failure\_threshold \= failure\_threshold  
        self.recovery\_timeout \= recovery\_timeout  
        self.failure\_count \= 0  
        self.last\_failure\_time \= None  
        self.state \= "CLOSED"  \# CLOSED, OPEN, HALF\_OPEN  
      
    def call\_external\_api(self, api\_function, \*args, \*\*kwargs):  
        if self.state \== "OPEN":  
            if time.time() \- self.last\_failure\_time \> self.recovery\_timeout:  
                self.state \= "HALF\_OPEN"  
            else:  
                raise CircuitBreakerOpenException("API temporarily unavailable")  
          
        try:  
            result \= api\_function(\*args, \*\*kwargs)  
            if self.state \== "HALF\_OPEN":  
                self.state \= "CLOSED"  
                self.failure\_count \= 0  
            return result  
        except Exception as e:  
            self.failure\_count \+= 1  
            self.last\_failure\_time \= time.time()  
              
            if self.failure\_count \>= self.failure\_threshold:  
                self.state \= "OPEN"  
              
            raise e

**Circuit Breaker Configuration:**

circuit\_breaker\_config:  
  apollo\_api:

  outreach\_agent\_unavailable:  
    immediate\_action: "Queue campaigns for later execution"  
    fallback\_mode: "Manual campaign creation interface"  
    restoration\_procedure: "Process queued campaigns on restoration"  
    
  deal\_agent\_unavailable:  
    immediate\_action: "Escalate all deals to human management"  
    fallback\_mode: "Traditional CRM deal pipeline"  
    restoration\_procedure: "Gradual re-automation with human oversight"

#### **Automatic Retry Policies**
