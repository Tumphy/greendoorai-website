# **Epic 9: Customer Expansion, Retention & Advocacy Automation**

Complete Agent-Centric User Journeys

## **Epic Overview**

**Name:** "Customer Expansion, Retention & Advocacy Automation"

**Vision:** Turn every new customer into a lifetime champion by proactively identifying expansion opportunities, automating value delivery, and turning success into referrals and advocacy. GreendoorAI transforms post-sale engagement from reactive support to proactive revenue expansion and customer advocacy orchestration.

üß© **Core Problem** After the deal is won, sellers are often sidelined while Customer Success teams struggle with reactive management. Critical expansion opportunities, churn risks, and advocacy potential slip through cracks due to manual processes, fragmented data, and lack of proactive intelligence. Teams miss early warning signs, underestimate expansion readiness, and fail to systematically convert satisfied customers into revenue-driving advocates.

‚ú® **The Magic** GreendoorAI becomes a Revenue Expansion AI Agent ecosystem‚Äîcontinuously monitoring account health, usage patterns, and engagement signals; automatically detecting churn risks and growth triggers; surfacing personalized success playbooks; and orchestrating renewal, expansion, and referral motions with predictive intelligence and automated execution.
