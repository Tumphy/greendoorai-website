# **Epic 7: Knowledge Ingestion, Auto-Learning & System-Wide Intelligence Sync**

## **Complete Agent-Centric User Journeys**

### **Epic Overview**

## **Name:** "Knowledge Ingestion, Auto-Learning & System-Wide Intelligence Sync"  **Vision:** Transform GreendoorAI into a strategic AI advisor with perfect organizational memory through autonomous knowledge ingestion, entity understanding, and continuous learning across all business contexts.

### **üß© Core Problem**

## Sales teams operate with fragmented knowledge scattered across emails, documents, conversations, and systems. Critical insights are buried, context is lost between interactions, and teams repeatedly "rediscover" information that already exists within the organization.

### **‚ú® The Magic**

## **LLM Agent Intelligence Network** continuously ingests, understands, and synthesizes all organizational knowledge to create a unified AI brain that knows everything about every account, contact, deal, competitor, and conversation‚Äîautomatically enriching every interaction with perfect context and strategic insights.
