# **Epic 3: Campaign Launch, Execution & Intelligent Optimization**

## **Epic Overview**

**Vision:** Transform launch-ready campaigns into self-optimizing revenue engines that execute flawlessly, learn continuously, and generate predictable pipeline without human intervention.

**Core Problem:** Even with perfect campaigns, execution is manual, response handling is inconsistent, optimization requires constant attention, and learning from results happens too slowly to drive meaningful improvement.

**The Magic:** Launch campaigns that run themselves \- automatically sending personalized outreach, handling responses intelligently, optimizing performance in real-time, and getting smarter with every interaction.

| AI Agent | Function |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Orchestration Agent** | Launches campaigns, manages pacing |
| **Response Agent** | Classifies, routes, and replies |
| **Optimization Agent** | Runs A/B tests, adjusts timing/steps |
| **Meeting Agent** | Books meetings, preps user, follows up |
| **Learning Agent** | Captures campaign insights and retrains models |
