\- üïµÔ∏è ‚ÄúProspect Hunter Agent‚Äù ‚Äì Finds matching companies, ranks them, and pulls public signals

\- üì¨ ‚ÄúPersona Outreach Agent‚Äù ‚Äì Generates channel-specific messages for mapped personas

These agents interact via a central coordinator agent, supported by a memory layer (embeddings \+ prompt history) and user actions.

**AI Stack:**

\- Website Analysis: GPT-4 \+ BeautifulSoup/NLP parser \+ LangChain agents

\- ICP Synthesis: GPT-4-turbo \+ fine-tuned embeddings on B2B ICP patterns

\- Contact Enrichment: GPT-assisted ranking \+ GraphQL from LinkedIn APIs (when available)
